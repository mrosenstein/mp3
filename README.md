We examined the maple sugaring season as it pertains to MacLeish. Using the maple_sap data set on gallons of sap collected and the weather data, we predicted the start date, end date, and yield for sugaring season. We utilized the MacLeish package to examine the weather patterns at the field station during the harvest, as well as using the spatial data of nearby maple sugarhouses in southwestern Massachusetts. We hope to use maple collection data to further extrapolate our weather information (using the Northeast Maple Syrup Production data from the National Agricultural Statistics Service**).

The most important part of weather that relates to sap collection is the temperature of the environment. The conditions of a temperature change of at least 1.1 degrees Celsius during the day yields the best amount of the sap, for the sap is able to move up and down the tree. The season length has varied recently due to climate change, but according to the National Agricultural Statistics Service, an average mapling season is about 30 days between mid-February and late March.
